= Mac OSX Color Palettes

== Install:

Copy these `*.clr` files into `~/Library/Colors/`. Open your color palette to view 
them. I personally use the [Hues](http://giantcomet.com/hues/) app to view my palettes.

In fact, I've bascially turned my `~/Library/Colors/` directory into this git repository.

== Palettes:

1. SpaceGray Eighties: Modified version from @kkga's "Hyperminimal UI Theme for
   Sublime", Spacegray. [Available here](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/).
2. # More coming soon.
